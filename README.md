orb
===

Orb is a computer program that can find hyperbolic structures on a large class of hyperbolic 3-orbifolds and 3-manifolds. It can start with a projection of a graph embedded in the 3-sphere, and produce and simplify a triangulation with some prescribed subgraph as part of the 1-skeleton and the remainder of the graph drilled out. It enables computation of hyperbolic structures on knot complements, graph complements and orbifolds whose underlying space is the 3-sphere minus a finite number of points.

The code was created by modifying Jeff Weeks' computer program SnapPea.
